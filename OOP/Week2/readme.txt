Exercise 1:
Create two Java Packages named package1 and package2. 
• package1 consists of two classes: Circle and Test1. 
• package2 has one class named Test2.
In package1, write a Java class named Circle which has two double variables: radius
and pi. pi variable should be declared as final double and assigned to 3.14. The Circle
class has also two methods named calculate_area() and calculate_perimeter(). The

signature of methods are as follows:
public double calculate_area();
public double calculate_perimeter();

a) Create an object of type Circle class in Test1. Assign an arbitrary value to the radius
varible and display the area and perimeter of object. 

b) Create an object of type Circle class in Test2 using the fully
qualified name of Circle class and calculate the area and perimeter
of object for an arbitrary radius.

c) Repeat part b using import statement.
