• Define four objects named p1,p2,p3,p4 in Main class.
• Create an p1 object whose parameters are assigned to 0.6 and 100.
• Assing p1 to p2.
• Create a p3 object whose parameters are assigned to 0.9 and 150.
• Assign p3 to p4.
• Call calculate_price() method for each object.
• Replace 1.5 with the weight parameter of p4 object.
• Call display method for p3 and p4.
• Recreate object p4 with parameters of 2 and 200.
• Call display method for p3 and p4.
