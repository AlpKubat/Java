Node class has name and left node informations.
Node class has two constructors:
First constructor takes node name as a parameter
Second constructor takes node name and its left node as parameters
Node class has also a recursive method named getPath() which returns
name of the node. The signature of method:
public String getPath();

• Create 9 objects n1,n2…n9 whose names are 1,2…9 in ManageNode
class.
• Print the graph from 1 to 9.
