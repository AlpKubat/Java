• Write a Java class named Item.

• Item class has name(String), price(double), amount(int) and
total(double) variables.

• Item class has a constructor which takes name, price and amount as
parameters. Calculate total inside Constructor.

• Item class has also a polymorphic method named ComputeTaxedPrice.

• Write two Java classes named Product and Service which are
subclasses of Item class.

• Product and Service classes have also the polymorphic method
named ComputeTaxedPrice which applies %18 tax for Product class
and %1 tax for Service class.

• Write a Main class and define an 4-element array of type Item class.

• The first element of array refers to object from Product class.
• The second element of array refers to object from Service class.
• The third element of array refers to object from Product class.
• The fourth element of array refers to object from Service class.

• Print the total taxed price of Product and Service objects
seperately.


Example output:

Total taxed price of Product is = 47789.469
Total taxed price of Service is = 727.2
